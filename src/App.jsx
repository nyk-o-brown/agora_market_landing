          <p><strong>Problem</strong>: Local sellers struggle to reach nearby buyers; discovery and trust are low; delivery coordination is fragmented.</p>

          <p><strong>Unique Value Proposition</strong>: A fast local marketplace that connects nearby sellers and buyers with integrated delivery and built-in trust signals, maximizing convenience and local discovery.</p>
          <p><strong>Solution</strong>: Geo-targeted listing feed; in-app chat and ratings; integrated payments; optional delivery booking; lightweight seller onboarding.</p>
          <p><strong>Channels</strong>: Local social groups; market associations; SMS/WhatsApp campaigns; in-app referrals; targeted local ads.</p>
          <p><strong>Revenue Streams</strong>: Ad placements in feed; commission on sales; flat or percentage delivery fees; promoted listings; subscription for seller analytics.</p>
